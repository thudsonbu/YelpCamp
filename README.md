# YelpCamp
YelpCamp is a database driven app using the MEN stack complete with a rest api, authentication, user permissions, and other cool features. Yelpcamp
can be used to save cool locations (mostly campgrounds) that you may want to revisit, view locations others have added, commend on locations, and 
much more.

# Tech Stack
YelpCamp runs on a Node server with Express serving pages. Currently, huroku is used to host the server as well as its MongoDB database and api. It is
a great first example of a MEN stack app with restful routing, user permissions, authentication, and asychronous programming for beginners.

# How to Use It
Yelpcamp is currently deployed at https://limitless-dawn-20788.herokuapp.com/. There arent exacly a lot of places there yet but maybe there will be 
at some point in the future. After the landing page you will find the list of campgrounds currently in the database and you can view each for a few more
details. Upon logging in or signing up you will be able to add, edit, and delete your own campgrounds as well as add comments to others campgrounds.
